  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Sometimes, especially on interviews, developers are asked about what would be
their steps to fix a database that works slowly. That’s a really extensive
subject to discuss. Here, I decided to summarize my experience. I hope it help
to not only increase the performance but do that in acceptable time and with
less misery.</p>

<p>First, of all, fixing the database queries is the last thing you should
do. Fixing code first is premature optimization that is a root of all evil as we
know. It could take huge amount of time whereas the real problem is kept in a
wrong configuration file.</p>

<p>So in my prospective, the right steps to make your database more peppy are
something like follows below. Keep in mind that it is not a technical tutorial
with code snippets that you could paste and make the job done.</p>

<p><strong>Ensure you use SSD drives.</strong> It sounds silly but still you should check
it. SSD gives you up to 10 times performance boost immediately. Ensure that SSD
drive is a highlighted feature in you hoster’s plan.</p>

<p><strong>Check you database config</strong> before tweaking something else. Usually, the
default configurations are set up poorly to make the DB work on cheap
computers. Some distributions carry config templates which names include memory
or CPU values. Read them, they are well-documented. Google for best practices
when configuring your database. Read books.</p>

<p>Consider a case when <strong>the entire database is kept in memory</strong>. That also
involves DBA and Ops teams so probably you won’t be allowed to perform such a
move by your own. But since memory is cheat nowadays, it is possible. For
backups, replicate such a database using streaming replications on servers that
are run on hard drives. PostgreSQL supports various replication scenarios as
well. You may also dump memory images into files and restore them on demand.</p>

<p>I used to work in a project where they ran 400Gb database into RAM and it worked
quite fast.</p>

<p><strong>Check you application uses connection pooling</strong> when communicating to the
DB. Suddenly, such wildly spreaded frameworks as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> do not use
them. On each HTTP request, they open a fresh connection and close it once the
response has been sent. Now imagine your application serves 20 requests per
second. Network communication will be quite expensive in that case!</p>

<p>Consider using either <a href="https://pgbouncer.github.io/">PGBouncer</a> in front your Postgres installation
or any library for your language that deals with reusable connections by its
own. Say, for Clojure, <a href="https://github.com/tomekw/hikari-cp">HikariCP</a> would be a good choice.</p>

<p><strong>Everything that might be read from replica should be read from it</strong>, not the
prod DB instance. Don’t run reports against the production. All the analytics
and statistics should not touch it. Modern frameworks allow you to declare
multiple database backends and switch between them on demand. For example, in
Django, calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">.using('replica')</code> method on a Queryset instance dispatches a
query into another database, not the default one.</p>

<p><strong>For quite complicated queries, use materialized views</strong> that may be turned
into physical tables on demand. Querying them would be much faster than
processing a query full of joins and aggregates every time. Setup a cron job to
rebuild such views every night for example when the load is low.</p>

<p><strong>Select only those fields that you really need</strong> to process a request. Avoid
using <code class="highlighter-rouge">select * from table</code> since it takes extra time for the database to find
out what fields to fetch exactly. With Django ORM, either specify needed fields
with <code class="highlighter-rouge">.only()</code> method or bypass some of them calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">.defer()</code>. But keep in
mind that touching a non-fetched field hits the database again.</p>

<p>When writing unit tests, <strong>add a case that counts a number of database queries</strong>
made during request. Sometimes, it leads to terrifying findings. Touching fields
of foreign entities in a cycle without joining them initially may end up with up
to 100 queries or more.</p>

<p><strong>Be carefull when passing a collection of IDs as a parameter.</strong> On the database
level, it turns into something like</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>STATEMENT: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (?, ?, ?, &lt;100 more of them&gt;)
PARAMETERS: $1=10035, $2=10036, $3=10037, $4=10038, $5=10039,...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When not limiting the number of such IDs, one may end up with 1000 of them what
is quite harmful for the database. Either process them by chunks or try to
compose a single query with raw SQL.</p>

<p>For fast data processing, <strong>don’t use ORM at all</strong>. Building a model instance
from a low-lever tuple that the database driver returns is really
costly. Even <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> (Python’s the most powerful ORM) spends
double time on building instances than reading data from <a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg2</a>
(Python PostgreSQL driver) directly.</p>

<p><strong>Denormalize your tables.</strong> Sometimes, it really worth moving any columns into
foreign tables and joining them on demand. A good example might be ranking
system. You’ve got a users table full of fields. Now you need to add rank field
and recalculate it every 6 hours. Adding yet another fields would be a bad
choice since our users table is already under load.</p>

<p>But having the <code class="highlighter-rouge">users_ranks</code> table that has a unique foreign key to a user and a
rank value would be a good choice. Now that, we may rewrite it as we wish
without touching actual user’s data. When needing to sort users by their rank,
we join that table and order the result by rank as well.</p>

<p>The same relates to a search document. When implementing full search on some
entity, we need to build a special document known as
a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-textsearch.html">search vector</a>. Storing that vector inside an entity is a bad
choice because it is not the data but just technical information.</p>

<p><strong>Join tables only by foreign and primary keys</strong> but not any custom conditions
like strings equality, regex matching and so on. When you need such a join,
probably it is better to fetch both parts of it and compose the result in your
app’s code.</p>

<p>When a query really works badly, <strong>examine it with EXPLAIN operator</strong>. If you
don’t understand its output completely, use <a href="https://explain.depesz.com/">online services</a> that turn
it into more human-friendly format. Ensure the query hits indexes. Don’t add
multiple indexes since having them a lot may slow down writing procedure.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>never be afraid of raw SQL</strong>. No matter how powerful your ORM is,
check what queries it produces exactly. On my dev machine, I always start
Postgres not as a service but as a process passing <code class="highlighter-rouge">-E</code> flag to print all the
queries:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>postgres <span class="nt">-E</span> <span class="nt">-D</span> /usr/local/var/postgres
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That gives me the whole vision of what’s going on with the database.</p>

<p>Summarizing all together:</p>

<ol>
  <li>use modern hardware;</li>
  <li>configure your database properly;</li>
  <li>know all the shadowed parts of your ORM;</li>
  <li>rise your SQL skills.</li>
</ol>
