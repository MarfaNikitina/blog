Recently, I found plenty of code that I usually borrow from project to project
without hosting it on GitHub. I think I may share some of that since it might be
useful to anybody.

[rome-site]: https://rometools.github.io/rome/

[remus]: https://github.com/igrishaev/remus

The first library I'd like to start with is a feed parser. There are already
some Clojure wrappers for [ROME][rome-site] and they even solve default
cases. But mine wrapper is special since it supports lots of additional options
and tweaks. So if you play with RSS a log, try [Remus][remus], the library I'm
introducing in this post.

[clj-http]: https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http

It's also built on top of ROME but uses [clj-http][clj-http] for HTTP
communication with all its features, e.t. redirects settings, connection
pooling, conditional requests by Etag.

Remus fetches all the possible data from a feed including non-standard tags for
further processing. Some feeds (YouTube, for example) distribute useful data
with custom XML tags, e.g video statistics or geographical coordinates.

Start with including the library into a project:

~~~clojure
:dependencies [[remus "0.1.0"]]
~~~


Import it:

~~~clojure
(ns your.project
  (:require [remus :refer [parse-url parse-file parse-stream]]))

;;;;
;; or
;;;;

(require '[remus :refer [parse-url parse-file parse-stream]])
~~~

Now parse a URL:

~~~clojure
(def result (parse-url "http://planet.clojure.in/atom.xml"))
~~~

The result will be a map with `:response` and `:feed` keys. The first one holds
an HTTP response. You'll need it to save some of the headers for further HTTP
communication. The `:feed` key contains a huge map representing a parsed feed:

~~~clojure
(def feed (:feed result))

(println feed)

;;;;
;; a small subset of the origin feed
;;;;

{:description nil,
 :feed-type "atom_1.0",
 :entries
 [{:description nil,
   :updated-date #inst "2018-08-13T10:00:00.000-00:00",
   :published-date nil,
   :title
   "PurelyFunctional.tv Newsletter 287: DataScript, GraphQL, CRDTs",
   :author "Eric Normand",
   :link
   "https://purelyfunctional.tv/issues/purelyfunctional-tv-newsletter-287-datascript-graphql-crdts/",
   :contributors (),
   :uri "https://purelyfunctional.tv/?p=28660",
   :contents
   ({:type "html",
     :mode nil,
     :value "long HTML here....."
     }),
 :extra {:tag :extra, :attrs nil, :content ()},
 :published-date #inst "2018-08-13T11:59:11.000-00:00",
 :entry-links
 ({:rel "alternate",
   :type nil,
   :href "http://planet.clojure.in/",
   :title nil,
   :length 0}
  {:rel "self",
   :type nil,
   :href "http://planet.clojure.in/atom.xml",
   :title nil,
   :length 0}),
 :title "Planet Clojure",
 :link "http://planet.clojure.in/",
 :webmaster nil,
 :uri "http://planet.clojure.in/atom.xml",
 :authors ()}
~~~

To parse a file:

~~~clojure
(def feed (parse-file "/path/to/some/atom.xml"))
~~~

This function returns just a feed data structure.

[toc]: https://github.com/igrishaev/remus#table-of-contents

Remus supports options to specify how to communicate via HTTP; how to deal with
broken or wrong encoded feeds; how to prevent receiving data you've already
processed. I described all of this in the [readme file][toc] and do not want to
clone that text here. Instead, please look through that file and examples. I
hope you'll find the library helpful and you'll use it one day when dealing with
RSS/Atom feeds.
