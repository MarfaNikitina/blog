Nice links to read:

- [SOLID Is OOP for Dummies](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/03/28/solid.html)

  For a long time, I've been thinking that I'm a single person who shares the
  same thoughts. Does anybody really believe it's possible to write SOLID code
  in production? It's totally marketing and advertising stuff.

- [Главный секрет удаленной работы](http://tema.livejournal.com/2473428.html)

  Short and clear note in respect of remote working. It's the main point that
  distinguish a remote worker from a freelancer (I become insane then they call
  me a freelancer btw).

- [RSI — как бороться с туннельным синдромом](http://lionet.livejournal.com/71005.html)

  Long and detailed story about troubles with hands caused by a keyboard told by
  Lev Valkin -- a famous ex-Russian functional programmer and entrepreneur.

- [Теперь и я ищу Робина](http://ksoftware.livejournal.com/242252.html)

  Just spontaneous thoughts about work.

- [Programming Hand Tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk3A41U0iO4)

  Nice speech on keyboards, Lisp and Clojure. Highly recommend you to watch.
