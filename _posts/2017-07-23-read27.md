[conf]:http://2017.euroclojure.org/

I've just returned from [EuroClojure][conf], it was amazing! Thank you everybody
who brought it to us.

Here are some interesting links I found on Medium:

- [The Lisp approach to AI (Part 1)](https://medium.com/ai-society/the-lisp-approach-to-ai-part-1-a48c7385a913)

  Some thoughts on role of Lisp in discovering AI systems.

- [Show me a business problem and I'll do my best to avoid it](https://m.signalvnoise.com/avoiding-not-solving-a1b37e46baaf)

  Jason Fried, a founder of Basecamp, shares his notes on dealing with problems.

- [A Pythonist finds a new home at Clojure land](https://notamonadtutorial.com/a-pythonist-finds-a-new-home-at-clojure-land-761ad8612b47)

  The title shares the idea as well.

- [Why I chose ClojureScript over JavaScript](https://m.oursky.com/why-i-chose-clojure-over-javascript-24f045daab7e)

  So do I.
