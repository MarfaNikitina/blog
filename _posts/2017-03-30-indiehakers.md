Today, Indie Hackers have [published my interview][url-ih] about
[Queryfeed][url-qf]. It's my pet project written with Clojure that I've beed
maintaining for five years.

It took about a week to answer all the questions and 3 weeks to wait for the
article is being published. The idea to submit an application to Indie Hackers
originally belongs to my English teacher who asked me to do that as a part of my
home work.

I used to write it by late nights so maybe that's why there is so lots of
melancholy. I remebered these days when I could not pragram and did silly
mistakes. This interview is rather advise to myself in the past and to everybody
who just started doing something for themselves, not for their daily work.

So, you are welcome to read that =) Feel free to ask your questions in comments
if you have some.
