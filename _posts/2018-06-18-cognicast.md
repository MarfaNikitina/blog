Being listening to [Cognicast][cognicast], a series of Clojure-related podcasts,
I've found a funny thing. Not sure if anybody has ever mentioned it before
across the Internet. Each podcast starts with a jingle sound that follows right
after announcements and a long pause. And in the end, there is also another
weird sound that finishes the issue.

Those two sounds are borrowed from the Gauntlet 4 video game. It is a great
fantasy game where one of the four characters travels through mazes full of
monsters to encounter a dragon at the end. I've played this game on Sega Mega
Drive (Sega Genesis in the US) for a long time being a kid.

This is the first sound. It appears when a hero picks up a key:

And this is the second when a hero goes through a portal:

I may guess there is a hidden message here: before entering a podcast, you pick
up a key. And finally, you exit from a maze with the victory.

The idea of that came to me when I found myself singing a musical theme from the
game right after the podcast has finished. I'm not sure if I'm right, but this
one is really a great message. Thanks to those guys who are responsible for
audio production.

Bonus: listen to the soundtrack. I hardly can imagine it was written using
primitive 8-bit midi-driver.
