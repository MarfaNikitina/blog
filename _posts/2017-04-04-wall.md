What a rare album I've found! It's the legendary "The Wall", but captured
directly from the movie with all the noises, phrases and ambients. Most of the
songs are played within a symphony orchestra. There are also two tracks appeared
only in the movie: "When The Tigers Broke Free" and "Empty Spaces".

Listen also to "Mother", "The Trial" and "Comfortably Numb". They sound quite
different to the studio records.

Oh god, that album made my week, not a day.
