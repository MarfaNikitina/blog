I decided to not stay in Russian-speaking communities anymore. No matter what
they are about: Clojure, Emacs, etc... When I see "...for Russian speakers" at
the end of the title my hand moves to the cross-button by itself.

The main problem of Russian communities is they are all about trolling and
rudeness. Every single person reckons them-self as a Single Source Of Truth no
matter what the facts say.

Even without opening a chat I can say what it is about. Definitely, to prove you
are the most clever guy all around.

Recently, I've been chatting in Russian Clojure community in Telegram
channel. That was awful. There were more then 100 people there, but only three
of them (including me) work with Clojue for their daily work.

Nevertheless, the chat was boiling all the time. People argued on functional
programming without any knowledge of that. There were trolls whose intentions
were just to throw shit on fan.

I knew a person who was only 3 months with Clojure but argued so violently like
he's been 30 years with Lisps and functional programming. It applies to almost
every member of discussion. On the first monitor, they have chat window and on
the second there is a Wiki page or Stack-overflow where they convulsively try to
find facts to support their opinion.

I looks so poorly.

And it's this the same with other messagers and channels. No matter what is the
subject of a community. In Russian-speaking group, it always ends up with a
question who is cooler.

That behaviour shows all the bad traits human have. We try to pretend we know
everything, be a leader (no matter in what way) hide our weaknesses and muffle
misunderstanding of something.

What's the point to read all that rubbish? Why do I need spend my time scrolling
a feed full of arrogance?

I must confess Russian people are rude in general. This is particularly
noticeable after you have told to non-Russian native speakers. Russian way of
discussing tend to be aggressive and even impolite sometimes.

So what should you do? As for me, it's better to join world-wide communities and
channels in English. I'm sure you can easily find out Slack or Google Group
channel for any language or technology you are interested in.

## Staying in Russian communities only stops your development and limits your horizons.

If you disagree with me I highly recommend you to read [that article][ivan]
written by Ivan Sagalaev, a famous Russian Python developer who moved to USA:
