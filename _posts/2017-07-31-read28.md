- [REST APIs are REST-in-Peace APIs. Long Live GraphQL.][link1]

  Well, although the title is provoking a bit, the main idea is true. We really
  need something more suitable than REST. It has been great for the last decade,
  but now it's time to move on.

- [XML manipulation in Clojure][link2]

  Great article on XML, trees and zippers in Clojure. For a long time, I was
  considering parsing XML as a sort of black magic. With Clojure, the process is
  transparent and easy to understand.

- [Students are Better Off without a Laptop in the Classroom][link3]

  Thoughts on using laptops by students in a classroom. Again, the profit of IT
  industry and "smart" devices is overestimated. As
  I [mentioned it earlier](/en/edu-startups), books and people are the only way
  to learn effectively.

- [Beyond Clojure: Haskell][link4]

  Comparing Haskell to Clojure: syntax, types, code snippets, etc.
