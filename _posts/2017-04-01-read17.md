I've got very interesting links today (most of them relate to Clojure and FP):

- [Fourteen Months with Clojure](https://blog.skyliner.io/fourteen-months-with-clojure-beb8b3e4bf00)

  > Building a server application with Clojure is a better experience than with
  > many compiled languages, because as with any Lisp, you can just hotpatch
  > everything in the REPL as you build it.

- [Changes I would make to Go](http://sitr.us/2017/02/21/changes-i-would-make-to-go.html)

  > In its current form, I prefer not to use Go. It is not that Go is bad - it
  > is just that there are lots of languages available that I find more
  > enjoyable. When I work with Go I cannot help thinking about how I could be
  > doing things differently in another language.

- [Comparing Reagent To React.Js And Vue.Js For Dynamic Tabular Data](http://yogthos.net/posts/2017-03-26-ReagentReactView.html)

  > ClojureScript version has a lot less syntactic noise, and I find this has
  > direct impact on my ability to reason about the code. The more quirks there
  > are, the more likely I am to misread the intent.

- [Why Functional Programming Matters](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf)

  23-pages academical paper that I'm going to read someday.
