Today, I published my first [Clojure book][book] about Java interop. It took 60 pages and seven chapters with five of them related to practice. I solve real cases borrowed from real projects I've have worked before in Clojure relying on Java a lot.

I decided to write such a paper because I got tired of more and more Clojure books published. They all consider their reader as a newbie and do leave enough room for extended topics.

The whole that book is a single extended topic. It consists of bits of knowledge I've been collecting for years. It is a tough and nerdy reading for those who bother with details. I'm really proud of I managed to complete it.
