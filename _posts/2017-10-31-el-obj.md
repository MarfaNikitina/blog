I've just got Yegor Bugayenko's ["Elegant Objects" book][site]. Even without
reading a single page of it, I can definitely say the book worths doing it. How
do I know in advance you may ask?

That's simple: it's got great design. You may prove it too when opening the book
at somewhere in the middle of it and scan the page.

How does an ordinary IT book look like? Usually, its design is full of details
made without any sense. A typical O'Reilly book makes me feel like a kid: it has
lots of different paragraph styles, borders, lines, gray bars. Before you start
reading, there is a legend with up to five icons. Look, that icon means to be
careful, this one stands for "experienced users only" and so forth. Every page
carries the author's name, the title of the book and the chapter caption as if I
really need to keep all of that in my mind constantly.

Instead, the Yegor's book are made of high quality design. Every page has only
text but nothing else. No lines, bars or icons. There only two text stiles per
the entire book, one is for ordinary text and the second one is for code. Again,
the code is not put into the colored bar or whatever. It's just text, and this
is amazing.

Except the main text, there is no any information on a page but its number. I
really appreciate such design because it servers the only thing it was aimed for
-- to encourage me to read the book (but not to buy and put it on my shelf).
