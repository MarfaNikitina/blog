<p>Are you sure you enjoyed Yegor's blog?))</p><p>&gt;&gt;  How may I track whether .setA was called or not? <br>Holy truth. That's why setters are bad. Use a constructor.<br><a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">http://www.yegor256.com/201...</a></p><p>I guess OOP version should be like:<br>Integer sum = new Sum(1, 2)</p><p>But as long Integer is not an interface we cannot make that.<br>So the compromise version would be a sort of:<br>Integer sum = new Sum(1, 2).intValue()</p><p>Yes it may look unnatural with current tools/languages though. But it is still one line.</p>
