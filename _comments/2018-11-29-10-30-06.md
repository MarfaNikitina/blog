<p>I would argue projects like Manifold (<a href="https://github.com/ztellman/manifold)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/ztellman/manifold)">https://github.com/ztellman...</a> and Promesa (<a href="https://funcool.github.io/promesa/latest/)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://funcool.github.io/promesa/latest/)">https://funcool.github.io/p...</a> totally have their place in the Clojure ecosystem (I can tell from experience that not all but many projects would be better off using that instead of / in addition to core.async). These projects expose monadic abstractions, for problems than raw Exceptions could not have addressed.</p>
