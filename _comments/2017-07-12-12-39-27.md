<p>Ivan, where did you buy book you mentioned - "Web development in Clojure"? Was that a russian online book store? If so, please give me a link, please. I already have this one "Clojure Programming: Practical Lisp for the Java World", but is not enough for me ).</p><p>On this topic, at different times, i tried some courses from Coursera, and other educational resources, and i think they are helpful, but only when you make your first steps at very early start point, and not so important as many people think. <br>A bad thing is that you can be addicted and go in for study further and further. So it is important to abort and start to learn deeper. And at this point paper books is irreplaceable for me with practice training at the same time.</p><p>While reading "Clojure Programming: Practical Lisp for the Java World", I even did try to have remote work in Clojure, and make test, using clojure, http-kit, concurrency features. Test was about getting stats from yandex blog api by keywords search. It was entertaining and interesting. I didn't get a job, but it was great training time i spend. And no courses will not replace knowledge i got that time.</p>
