<p>Icons have no business being in an effing font or a charset standard, but as they nonetheless are, I also use them in my projects out of sheer laziness.</p><p>One point about using color balls in web apps though: not every browser and OS supply the actual icons for emoji glyphs. When the original glyphs are used, they have no color. Just a heads up with using the color and not the shape to signal a value.</p>
