<p>Looks nice, but again, you've implemented lots of stuff whereas it could be picked up from existing libraries, clojure.spec for example. In your case, you declare a huge map of maps with your own validators and coercers. The same could be easily achieved if you had an EDN file with a map inside, then you pass it through spec/conform to coerce and validate values. The only problem here will be returning human-friendly error messages since spec is not good for that. But a short function is enough to turn a `problem` node from spec error output into a clear message.</p>
