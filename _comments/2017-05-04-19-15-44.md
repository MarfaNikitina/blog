<p>I absolutely agree with you! It’s not that place when you feel like home and want to stay.</p><p>That community mostly about bashing “wrong” technologies, “wrong” people, “wrong” ideas. They bash FP, OOP, React, PHP, Erlang, Yandex, feminism, not being a feminist, name it. They put so much effort fighting with others flaws like it is the last fight ever with the pure Evil. There is no ideal thing in the world except them, their Holy Grail language, their supreme workflow, etc.</p><p>All that stuff is not about creation, not about healthy criticism. It’s a dirty hole full of misanthropic mocking pubertal grown ups. They try to fight with their angst just by slinging mud at everything that doesn’t fit their ideal anxious fantasy worlds.</p><p>I do not want to hear that lost teens confessions. Maybe they try to say “Help me! I’m stupidly rude and cynical because I’m totally fucked up” in a such way? Well, I do not care.</p><p>I literally cannot use Twitter being logged out because I have a tonne of blocked profiles of cynical persons in that community just to filter their shit out.</p>
