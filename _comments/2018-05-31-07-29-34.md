<p>You might want to check Omniconf. The main value prop is that you have to define all the configuration your app takes upfront â€“ and then, you can use EDN files, CLI parameters, or ENV vars as sources of the configuration. Thus, there's no magic when parsing the parameters, if you said in the code that :api-key is a string, it will be filled with a string regardless whether the value is coming from. On top of that, you get verification (make sure all necessary parameters are provided and have the correct type before the main code runs) and visibility (show the whole configuration map at the start of the program).</p><p>[1] <a href="https://github.com/grammarly/omniconf" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/grammarly/omniconf">https://github.com/grammarl...</a></p>
