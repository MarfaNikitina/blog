<p>In terms of "conceptual languages" is Scala conceptual? Many core concepts are implemented the same like in Huskell (currying, pattern-matching), HOF, strict types, immutable structures, type inference, it has interop. with Java like Clojure, strongly oriented to expressions. But Scala also is such a mix of two worlds - OOP and FP, maybe it attempts to be a "silver bullet", if so - it's bad, i think. If not, maybe, it's not so bad...Scala got advantages of both worlds...What's your thoughts?<br>P.S. Thank's for your advice about ABEbooks ;). I just got notification that my Clojure book arrived to postoffice.</p>
