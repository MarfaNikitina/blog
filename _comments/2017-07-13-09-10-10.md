<p>Great article! I'll be referring to this if we decide to migrate. It's worth poonting out that Datomic is not free from "bridge" or "join" tables. It has ref value types which are equivalent to foreign keys in Postgres, but these kinds of tables serve a different purpose, which is to allow metadata to be added to a relationship.</p><p>Say I'm keeping info about how people make tea. Some people do the add-teabag step first, some people do the add-sugar step, and some crazy people even add the milk before the water. So I have Person entities and Step entities, but to store the order in which each person performs the steps, we create a join entity which has refs to the other two (just like a join table in SQL), but also contains an index for the ordering.</p><p>In this way we can store attributes about the relationship itself.</p>
