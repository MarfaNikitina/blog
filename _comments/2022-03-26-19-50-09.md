<p>Andy, you're missing some context that my Russian readers are aware about. In Russia, it's strictly prohibited to name the Ukrainian events as "war". Instead, our government proposes such terms as "tactical operation" and like this. People who against the war cannot use that noun directly, so they put the "right terms" in quotes, e.g. "not-war", "operation" and so forth. What is meant by this, "you know I'm talking about the war and I'm agains this".</p>
