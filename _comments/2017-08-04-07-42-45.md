<p>Hi, I tried Scala a bit and even read a book "Atomic Scala", here is a short review in Russian: <a href="http://grishaev.me/atomic-scala" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://grishaev.me/atomic-scala">http://grishaev.me/atomic-s...</a></p><p>For me, Scala seems to be too complicated and aimed at too many goals to achieve. There is no a single idea that you can fit in one sentence. I'm not a fan of idea "take the best from two words", because too oftenly you end up with "the worst from two worlds".</p>
